A **pure C**, **zero-dependency** weather forecast CLI. Built entirely from scratch using POSIX sockets and manual JSON parsing.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive TUI Dashboard**: A beautiful, color-coded dashboard built with pure ANSI
- **100% Pure C**: No external libraries whatsoever
- **Raw POSIX Sockets**: Manual HTTP/1.1 implementation
- **Hand-Crafted JSON Parser**: Recursive descent parser for Open-Meteo API responses
- **ANSI Terminal Colors**: Beautiful, color-coded weather output
- **Ultra-Lightweight**: Compiles to ~36KB on most systems
- **Universal**: Works on any UNIX-like system (Linux, macOS, BSD)

## 🚀 Quick Start
